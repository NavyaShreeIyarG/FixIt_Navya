# Essential C++ Interview Questions for Freshers

<ComicQA
  question="1) What are the basic data types in C++?"
  answer="C++ provides primitive data types like int, float, double, char, and bool to handle different kinds of data. int stores integers, float/double store floating-point numbers (with different precision), char stores single characters, and bool stores true/false values."
  code={`int age = 25;
float price = 19.99f;
double pi = 3.14159265359;
char grade = 'A';
bool isValid = true;`}
  example={`// Using different data types
int counter = 0;
float temperature = 98.6f;
double atomicMass = 1.00784;
char initial = 'J';
bool isReady = false;`}
  whenToUse="Choose data types based on required precision and range: int for counting, float/double for decimals (depending on precision needed), char for characters, bool for logical values."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What is the difference between float and double in C++?"
  answer="float is single-precision (4 bytes, ~6 decimal digits) while double is double-precision (8 bytes, ~15 decimal digits). double offers more precision but uses more memory."
  code={`float f = 1.234567f;    // Loses precision after 6 digits
double d = 1.23456789012345; // Maintains precision up to 15 digits`}
  example={`// When precision matters
float circleArea = 3.14159f * radius * radius;  // OK for rough estimates
double scientificValue = 6.02214076e23;        // Needed for high precision`}
  whenToUse="Use float when memory efficiency is crucial and approximate values suffice. Use double when high precision is required (scientific calculations, financial applications)."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is a pointer in C++?"
  answer="A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It enables indirect access and manipulation of data."
  code={`int var = 42;
int *ptr = &var;  // ptr now contains the address of var
*ptr = 100;       // Changes the value of var through pointer`}
  example={`// Dynamic memory allocation
int *arr = new int[10];  // Pointer to dynamically allocated array
delete[] arr;            // Must be manually deallocated`}
  whenToUse="Use pointers for dynamic memory management, passing large data efficiently (by reference), and building complex data structures like linked lists/trees."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) How is an array different from a pointer in C++?"
  answer="Arrays are fixed-size contiguous memory blocks, while pointers are variables that store memory addresses. Arrays cannot be resized, but pointers can point to different memory locations."
  code={`int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};  // Array declaration
int *ptr = arr;          // Pointer to first element
ptr++;                   // Valid - moves to next address
// arr++;                // Invalid - array name isn't modifiable`}
  example={`// Array vs pointer usage
char str1[] = "Hello";   // Array (fixed size)
char *str2 = "World";    // Pointer to string literal`}
  whenToUse="Use arrays when size is known at compile-time. Use pointers when you need dynamic memory allocation or flexible data structures."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) What is the use of the new keyword in C++?"
  answer="The new operator dynamically allocates memory on the heap during runtime and returns a pointer to the allocated memory."
  code={`int *num = new int(5);      // Single integer
int *arr = new int[10];     // Array of 10 integers
// Must be freed later:
delete num;
delete[] arr;`}
  example={`// Creating objects dynamically
class Car { /*...*/ };
Car *myCar = new Car();  // Allocates Car object on heap
delete myCar;            // Cleanup`}
  whenToUse="Use new when you need dynamic memory allocation (size unknown at compile time) or when objects need to persist beyond their scope."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="6) Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++."
  answer="OOP organizes code into objects containing data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Its pillars are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction."
  code={`class Animal {          // Encapsulation
private:
    string name;            // Data hidden
public:
    void speak() { /*...*/ } // Public interface
};
class Dog : public Animal { // Inheritance
public:
    void speak() override { cout << "Woof!"; } // Polymorphism
};`}
  example={`// Abstraction example
class ATM {
public:
    void withdraw() { /*...*/ }  // User doesn't need to know internals
private:
    void verifyPin() { /*...*/ }
};`}
  whenToUse="Use OOP for complex systems requiring modularity, code reuse (inheritance), and clear interfaces (abstraction). Ideal for GUI apps, games, and large-scale software."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) What are access specifiers in C++?"
  answer="Access specifiers control member visibility: public (accessible anywhere), protected (accessible within class and derived classes), and private (accessible only within class)."
  code={`class Example {
public:    // Accessible to all
    int x;
protected: // Accessible to derived classes
    int y;
private:   // Accessible only here
    int z;
};`}
  example={`// Practical usage
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // Hidden internal state
public:
    void deposit(double amount) { /*...*/ }  // Public interface
};`}
  whenToUse="Use private for implementation details, public for interfaces, and protected when derived classes need special access while still hiding from external code."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What is a constructor in C++?"
  answer="A constructor is a special member function that initializes objects when they're created. It has the same name as the class and no return type."
  code={`class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
public:
    Rectangle(int w, int h) {  // Constructor
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
};`}
  example={`// Different constructor types
class Student {
public:
    Student() { /* Default */ }
    Student(string n) { /* Parameterized */ }
    Student(const Student &s) { /* Copy */ }
};`}
  whenToUse="Use constructors to initialize object state, allocate resources, or establish invariants whenever an object is created (default, parameterized, or copy initialization)."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is the difference between struct and class in C++?"
  answer="The only technical difference is default access: struct members are public by default, while class members are private by default. Conventionally, structs are used for passive data, classes for active objects."
  code={`struct Point {   // Default: public
    int x, y;
};

class Circle {    // Default: private
    double radius;
public:
    double area() { /*...*/ }
};`}
  example={`// Typical usage
struct DataPacket {  // Plain data container
    int id;
    double values[10];
};

class Sensor {      // Complex behavior
private:
    DataPacket data;
public:
    void calibrate() { /*...*/ }
};`}
  whenToUse="Use struct for simple data aggregates (POD types). Use class when you need encapsulation, invariants, or complex behavior."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10) What are inline functions in C++?"
  answer="Inline functions suggest to the compiler to replace function calls with the actual function code to reduce call overhead. Best for small, frequently called functions."
  code={`inline int max(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

// Call becomes:
// int result = (x > y) ? x : y;`}
  example={`// Header file implementation
class MathUtils {
public:
    inline static int square(int x) { return x * x; }
};`}
  whenToUse="Use inline for small functions (1-3 lines) called frequently in performance-critical code. Avoid for large functions as it can increase binary size."
