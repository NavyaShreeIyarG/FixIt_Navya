# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Operator Overloading**

<ComicQA
  question="1. What is operator overloading in C++?"
  code={`class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
};`}
  answer="Operator overloading in C++ allows redefining operators for user-defined types, enhancing code readability and usability."
  example="Use operator overloading when working with complex data types to improve code clarity."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2. How do you overload the << and >> operators in C++?"
  code={`#include <iostream>
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Complex& obj);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Complex& obj) {
    out << obj.real << " + " << obj.imag << "i";
    return out;
}`}
  answer="The << and >> operators are overloaded as friend functions to facilitate formatted input and output for custom classes."
  example="Use these operators to simplify object serialization and debugging."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3. What is the difference between member function and friend function in operator overloading?"
  code={`class Sample {
public:
    int value;
    Sample(int v) : value(v) {}
    Sample operator+(const Sample& obj) { return Sample(value + obj.value); }
    friend Sample operator-(const Sample& a, const Sample& b);
};

Sample operator-(const Sample& a, const Sample& b) {
    return Sample(a.value - b.value);
}`}
  answer="Member functions allow the left operand to be the calling object, while friend functions provide more flexibility."
  example="Use member functions when the left operand is an object of the class; use friend functions for symmetry in binary operations."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4. What are the best practices for operator overloading?"
  code={`// Guidelines
// - Use const for non-modifying methods
// - Follow natural operator meanings
// - Overload << >> for I/O`}
  answer="Operator overloading should follow intuitive behavior, ensure efficiency, and use const where necessary."
  example="Follow best practices to maintain readability and avoid unintended behavior."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5. Can all operators be overloaded in C++?"
  code={`// Not Overloadable:
// ::  .  .*  sizeof  typeid  ?:  alignof  noexcept`}
  answer="No, some operators like ::, ., sizeof, and ?: cannot be overloaded in C++."
  example="Remember these exceptions when designing custom types."

<ComicQA
  question="6. Why use friend functions for operator overloading?"
  code={`class Distance {
    int meters;
public:
    Distance(int m) : meters(m) {}
    friend Distance operator+(const Distance& a, const Distance& b);
};

Distance operator+(const Distance& a, const Distance& b) {
    return Distance(a.meters + b.meters);
}`}
  answer="Friend functions allow access to private data and support symmetric binary operations."
  example="Use when both operands are not class instances or to access private members."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7. How to overload comparison operators in C++?"
  code={`class Box {
public:
    int size;
    Box(int s) : size(s) {}
    bool operator==(const Box& other) const {
        return size == other.size;
    }
};`}
  answer="Comparison operators like ==, !=, <, > can be overloaded to compare user-defined types."
  example="Overload these for meaningful comparisons in containers or logic checks."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8. How do you overload the [] operator?"
  code={`class Array {
    int data[10];
public:
    int& operator[](int index) {
        return data[index];
    }
};`}
  answer="Overload the [] operator to provide array-like access to class members."
  example="Used when you want custom index access, like in matrix or list implementations."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9. How to overload assignment operator (=) correctly?"
  code={`class Resource {
    int* ptr;
public:
    Resource(int v) { ptr = new int(v); }
    Resource& operator=(const Resource& obj) {
        if (this != &obj) {
            delete ptr;
            ptr = new int(*obj.ptr);
        }
        return *this;
    }
};`}
  answer="Overload assignment operator to handle deep copy and avoid memory issues."
  example="Always implement copy assignment when dealing with dynamic memory."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10. What is the role of operator overloading in STL containers?"
  code={`// Example: std::set uses < operator
class Point {
public:
    int x, y;
    bool operator<(const Point& p) const {
        return x < p.x || (x == p.x && y < p.y);
    }
};`}
  answer="STL containers rely on operator overloading (like <) for sorting and uniqueness."
  example="Define comparison logic for custom types used in sets, maps, etc."
