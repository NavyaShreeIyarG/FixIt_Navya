title: Essential C++ Interview Questions on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
description: |
  This guide covers essential C++ interview questions on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Understand the key OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation in C++. These concepts are fundamental to C++ programming and often come up in interviews. Prepare for questions on OOP principles, design patterns, and how they are implemented in C++ to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Object-Oriented Programming**

<ComicQA
  question="1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++?"
  code={`class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    void show() { std::cout << "Car brand: " << brand << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.show();
    return 0;
}`}
  answer="OOP in C++ structures code into objects and classes to improve reusability and maintainability. It follows principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism."
  example="OOP is great for designing large, modular systems with reusable components."
  whenToUse="Use OOP for complex systems requiring modularity and scalability."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2. What is encapsulation in C++?"
  code={`class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void setBalance(double b) { balance = b; }
    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};`}
  answer="Encapsulation in C++ ensures data protection by restricting direct access and using getter/setter methods."
  example="Encapsulation is used in financial applications where sensitive data must be protected."
  whenToUse="Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data and enforce data integrity."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3. What is inheritance in C++?"
  code={`class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() { std::cout << "Starting vehicle" << std::endl; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() { std::cout << "Beep beep!" << std::endl; }
};`}
  answer="Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class."
  example="Cars and bikes inherit common features from the base class Vehicle."
  whenToUse="Use when different classes share common behavior or structure."
