# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Memory Management**
<ComicQA
  question="1) What is memory management in C++?"
  answer="Memory management in C++ involves controlling the allocation and deallocation of memory resources, including stack allocation for automatic variables and heap allocation for dynamic memory."
  code={`// Stack allocation (automatic)
int stackVar = 42;

// Heap allocation (manual)
int* heapVar = new int(42);
delete heapVar;`}
  example={`// Common memory operations:
// 1. Automatic stack variables
// 2. Dynamic heap allocation with new/delete
// 3. Smart pointer management
// 4. Custom allocators`}
  whenToUse="Understand memory management when working with dynamic data structures, resource-constrained systems, or performance-critical applications."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What are smart pointers and why use them?"
  answer="Smart pointers are template classes that automatically manage dynamic memory through RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), preventing memory leaks."
  code={`#include <memory>

// Unique ownership
std::unique_ptr<int> uptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);

// Shared ownership
std::shared_ptr<int> sptr = std::make_shared<int>(20);

// Non-owning reference
std::weak_ptr<int> wptr = sptr;`}
  example={`// Smart pointer use cases:
// 1. unique_ptr - Exclusive resource ownership
// 2. shared_ptr - Shared resource with reference counting
// 3. weak_ptr - Break circular references in shared_ptr`}
  whenToUse="Always prefer smart pointers over raw pointers for exception-safe memory management in modern C++."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is a memory leak and how to prevent it?"
  answer="A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory isn't properly deallocated, causing gradual memory exhaustion."
  code={`void leakyFunction() {
    int* leak = new int[100];  // Never deleted
}

void safeFunction() {
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> safe(new int[100]);
    // Automatically deleted
}`}
  example={`// Leak prevention techniques:
// 1. Use smart pointers
// 2. Follow RAII principles
// 3. Use containers instead of raw arrays
// 4. Tools: Valgrind, AddressSanitizer`}
  whenToUse="Be vigilant about memory leaks in long-running applications and when working with legacy code using raw pointers."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) What is the difference between stack and heap memory?"
  answer="Stack memory is automatically managed with fast allocation/deallocation for local variables, while heap memory is manually managed for dynamic allocation with slower access."
  code={`void memoryExample() {
    int stackVar = 10;           // Stack
    int* heapVar = new int(20);  // Heap
    delete heapVar;
}`}
  example={`// Stack vs Heap characteristics:
//                  Stack          Heap
// Management:    Automatic      Manual
// Size:          Limited        Large
// Speed:        Very fast      Slower
// Lifetime:    Scope-bound    Until deleted`}
  whenToUse="Use stack for small, short-lived variables; heap for large or dynamically-sized data that must persist beyond scope."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) How do new/delete differ from malloc()/free()?"
  answer="new/delete are C++ operators that handle both memory allocation and object construction/destruction, while malloc()/free() are C functions that only manage raw memory."
  code={`// C++ style
MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
delete obj;

// C style
MyClass* obj = (MyClass*)malloc(sizeof(MyClass));
free(obj);`}
  example={`// Key differences:
// 1. new calls constructors, malloc doesn't
// 2. delete calls destructors, free doesn't
// 3. new is type-safe, malloc requires casts
// 4. new can be overloaded, malloc cannot`}
  whenToUse="Always prefer new/delete in C++ except when interfacing with C libraries or implementing custom memory managers."

<ComicQA
  question="6) What is a dangling pointer and how to avoid it?"
  answer="A dangling pointer refers to memory that has been deallocated. Accessing it causes undefined behavior."
  code={`int* createDangling() {
    int x = 10;
    return &x;  // Dangling - x destroyed when function exits
}

void safeExample() {
    std::shared_ptr<int> safe = std::make_shared<int>(20);
    // No dangling possible
}`}
  example={`// Dangling pointer scenarios:
// 1. Returning local variable address
// 2. Using pointer after delete
// 3. Accessing freed memory in containers
// 4. Invalid iterator usage`}
  whenToUse="Avoid dangling pointers by using smart pointers, following object lifetime rules, and setting pointers to nullptr after deletion."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) What is RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)?"
  answer="RAII is a C++ programming technique where resource management is tied to object lifetime - resources are acquired during object construction and released during destruction."
  code={`class FileHandler {
    FILE* file;
public:
    FileHandler(const char* name) : file(fopen(name, "r")) {}
    ~FileHandler() { if (file) fclose(file); }
    
    // Disallow copying
    FileHandler(const FileHandler&) = delete;
    FileHandler& operator=(const FileHandler&) = delete;
};`}
  example={`// RAII applications:
// 1. Memory management (smart pointers)
// 2. File handling
// 3. Lock management (mutexes)
// 4. Database connections`}
  whenToUse="Apply RAII whenever managing resources that need deterministic cleanup - it provides exception safety and prevents resource leaks."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What is the Rule of Three/Five/Zero?"
  answer="These rules govern special member function implementation when managing resources: Rule of Three (copy ctor, copy assignment, dtor), Five (adds move operations), and Zero (prefer compiler-generated defaults)."
  code={`class RuleOfFive {
    int* data;
public:
    // 1. Destructor
    ~RuleOfFive() { delete data; }
    
    // 2. Copy constructor
    RuleOfFive(const RuleOfFive& other) : 
        data(new int(*other.data)) {}
        
    // 3. Copy assignment
    RuleOfFive& operator=(const RuleOfFive& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }
    
    // 4. Move constructor
    RuleOfFive(RuleOfFive&& other) noexcept : 
        data(other.data) { other.data = nullptr; }
        
    // 5. Move assignment
    RuleOfFive& operator=(RuleOfFive&& other) noexcept {
        std::swap(data, other.data);
        return *this;
    }
};`}
  example={`// Modern C++ practice:
// - Follow Rule of Five when managing resources
// - Prefer Rule of Zero (use smart pointers/containers)
// - Always consider exception safety`}
  whenToUse="Implement the Rule of Five when writing resource-managing classes. Follow Rule of Zero by using smart pointers and STL containers when possible."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is memory fragmentation and how to minimize it?"
  answer="Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory becomes divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, reducing available contiguous memory despite sufficient total free space."
  code={`// Fragmentation example:
void* block1 = malloc(1024);
void* block2 = malloc(1024);
free(block1);
// Now have 1024 free bytes, but may not be able to allocate 2048`}
  example={`// Fragmentation mitigation:
// 1. Use memory pools
// 2. Preallocate large blocks
// 3. Use custom allocators
// 4. Minimize allocation/deallocation frequency`}
  whenToUse="Address fragmentation in long-running applications, real-time systems, or when working with constrained memory environments."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10) How does std::make_shared differ from shared_ptr constructor?"
  answer="std::make_shared performs a single allocation for both the object and its control block, while shared_ptr constructor requires two separate allocations."
  code={`// More efficient
auto sp1 = std::make_shared<Widget>();

// Less efficient
std::shared_ptr<Widget> sp2(new Widget);`}
  example={`// make_shared advantages:
// 1. Single allocation (faster)
// 2. Better cache locality
// 3. Exception safety
// 
// Limitations:
// 1. Can't specify custom deleter
// 2. Control block lives until last weak_ptr`}
  whenToUse="Prefer make_shared unless you need custom deleters or separate allocations for the object and control block."
