# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Classes and Objects**

<ComicQA
  question="1) What is a class in C++?"
  answer="A class is a user-defined blueprint that encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit, serving as a template for object creation."
  code={`class Rectangle {
private:
    double width, height;  // Data members

public:
    // Member functions
    void setDimensions(double w, double h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
    
    double area() const {
        return width * height;
    }
};`}
  example={`// Class usage in real-world modeling:
// BankAccount class with balance and transactions
// Employee class with personal details and salary
// Vehicle class with properties and movement methods`}
  whenToUse="Use classes when you need to model real-world entities with both state (data) and behavior (functions), especially in object-oriented designs."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What is an object in C++?"
  answer="An object is a concrete instance of a class that occupies memory and contains actual data values for the class attributes."
  code={`Rectangle rect1;  // Object creation
rect1.setDimensions(5.0, 3.0);
cout << "Area: " << rect1.area();

Rectangle* rect2 = new Rectangle();  // Dynamic object
rect2->setDimensions(4.0, 6.0);`}
  example={`// Multiple objects from same class:
// Car object1 ("Toyota", 2022)
// Car object2 ("Honda", 2023)
// Each maintains its own separate state`}
  whenToUse="Create objects whenever you need to work with specific instances of a class, each with their own unique data values."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is encapsulation in C++?"
  answer="Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, while restricting direct access to internal implementation details."
  code={`class BankAccount {
private:  // Hidden implementation
    double balance;
    string accountNumber;

public:  // Public interface
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
    
    bool withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    double getBalance() const { return balance; }
};`}
  example={`// Encapsulation benefits:
// 1. Prevents invalid balance modifications
// 2. Validates deposit/withdrawal amounts
// 3. Hides account number implementation`}
  whenToUse="Use encapsulation whenever you need to protect internal state, maintain invariants, or hide implementation details from users of your class."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) What are constructors and destructors?"
  answer="Constructors initialize new objects (called on creation), while destructors clean up resources (called when objects are destroyed)."
  code={`class Student {
    string name;
    int id;
public:
    // Constructor
    Student(string n, int i) : name(n), id(i) {}
    
    // Destructor
    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destroying student: " << name;
    }
    
    // Copy constructor
    Student(const Student& other) : name(other.name), id(other.id) {}
};`}
  example={`// Special member functions:
// 1. Default constructor (no params)
// 2. Parameterized constructor
// 3. Copy constructor
// 4. Move constructor (C++11)
// 5. Destructor`}
  whenToUse="Define constructors when objects need initialization, and destructors when they hold resources (memory, files, locks) that need releasing."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) What is the difference between struct and class?"
  answer="In C++, the only technical difference is default access: struct members are public by default, class members are private. Conventionally, structs are used for passive data, classes for active objects."
  code={`struct Point {  // Default public
    int x, y;
    void print() { cout << x << "," << y; }
};

class Circle {  // Default private
    Point center;
    double radius;
public:
    void draw() { /*...*/ }
};`}
  example={`// Typical usage:
// struct - Data containers (Point, Color, Vertex)
// class - Complex objects (BankAccount, Employee)
// POD (Plain Old Data) types often use struct`}
  whenToUse="Use struct for simple data aggregates, class when you need encapsulation and complex functionality. The choice often communicates intent to other developers."

<ComicQA
  question="6) What are access specifiers in C++?"
  answer="Access specifiers (public, private, protected) control member visibility: public (anywhere), private (class-only), protected (class and derived classes)."
  code={`class AccessExample {
public:    // Accessible to all
    int openValue;
    
protected: // Accessible to derived classes
    int inheritedValue;
    
private:   // Accessible only here
    int secretValue;
};`}
  example={`// Good encapsulation practice:
// 1. Make data members private
// 2. Provide public getters/setters if needed
// 3. Use protected for derived class access`}
  whenToUse="Use access specifiers to enforce encapsulation - hide implementation details (private), expose safe interfaces (public), and allow controlled inheritance (protected)."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) What is the 'this' pointer?"
  answer="'this' is a hidden pointer in every non-static member function that points to the current object instance, used to disambiguate between parameters and members."
  code={`class Counter {
    int count;
public:
    void setCount(int count) {
        this->count = count;  // Distinguish parameter from member
    }
    
    Counter* getAddress() {
        return this;  // Return current object pointer
    }
};`}
  example={`// Common 'this' uses:
// 1. Resolving name conflicts
// 2. Chaining member function calls
// 3. Passing self-reference
// 4. In operator overloading`}
  whenToUse="Use 'this' when you need to explicitly refer to the current object, especially in situations where names might conflict."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What are static class members?"
  answer="Static members belong to the class itself rather than individual objects. Static variables have one shared copy, static functions can be called without an object."
  code={`class Employee {
    static int count;  // Shared across all objects
    string name;
public:
    Employee(string n) : name(n) { count++; }
    static int getCount() { return count; }  // Can call without object
};

int Employee::count = 0;  // Static definition`}
  example={`// Static member uses:
// 1. Tracking object counts
// 2. Shared configuration
// 3. Utility functions that don't need instance data
// 4. Singleton pattern implementation`}
  whenToUse="Use static members for class-wide properties and operations that don't depend on specific object state."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is a friend class/function?"
  answer="A friend declaration grants special access to private/protected members to specific external functions or classes, breaking encapsulation selectively."
  code={`class SecureBox {
    string secret;
public:
    friend class SecurityManager;  // Friend class
    friend void peek(const SecureBox&);  // Friend function
};

class SecurityManager {
public:
    static string inspect(const SecureBox& box) {
        return box.secret;  // Allowed due to friendship
    }
};`}
  example={`// Justified friend uses:
// 1. Operator overloading
// 2. Tightly coupled classes
// 3. Test classes needing white-box access
// 4. Factory patterns`}
  whenToUse="Use friends sparingly when you need to break encapsulation for specific, well-justified cases, typically for operator overloading or tightly coupled classes."

<ComicQA
  question="10) How are objects stored in memory?"
  answer="Objects are stored contiguously with their data members in declared order (plus padding for alignment). Member functions exist once in code memory, not per object."
  code={`class MemoryLayout {
    char c;   // 1 byte (+3 padding)
    int i;    // 4 bytes
    double d; // 8 bytes
    // Total size likely 16 bytes due to alignment
};`}
  example={`// Memory considerations:
// 1. Order members by size to minimize padding
// 2. Virtual functions add vtable pointer
// 3. Inheritance affects layout
// 4. Empty classes still occupy 1 byte`}
  whenToUse="Understand memory layout when optimizing for space/performance, working with low-level operations, or interfacing with C code."
