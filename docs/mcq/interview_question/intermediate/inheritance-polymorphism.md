title: Essential C++ Interview Questions on Inheritance and Polymorphism
description: "This guide covers essential C++ interview questions on inheritance and polymorphism, two of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Learn about different types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical) and how polymorphism allows you to write flexible and reusable code. Understand the implementation of virtual functions, function overriding, and dynamic binding in C++ to prepare for technical interviews."

# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Inheritance and Polymorphism**
<ComicQA
  question="1) What is inheritance in C++?"
  answer="Inheritance allows one class (derived) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (base), enabling code reuse and hierarchical design."
  code={`class Base {
  public:
    void show() { std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {};

int main() {
  Derived d;
  d.show();  // Inherited from Base
  return 0;
}`}
  example={`// Class Animal
// └── Class Dog inherits from Animal
// Dog gets Animal's functions like eat(), sleep(), etc.`}
  whenToUse="Use inheritance to model 'is-a' relationships and reuse common code among related classes."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What is polymorphism in C++?"
  answer="Polymorphism allows a function or method to behave differently based on the object invoking it. It supports dynamic behavior via method overriding."
  code={`class Base {
  public:
    virtual void show() { std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
  public:
    void show() override { std::cout << "Derived class" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
  Base* b = new Derived();
  b->show();  // Calls Derived class implementation
  delete b;
}`}
  example={`// Shape* s = new Circle();
// s->draw();  // Calls Circle's draw even though type is Shape*`}
  whenToUse="Use polymorphism when designing systems requiring dynamic method dispatch based on object type."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What are virtual functions in C++?"
  answer="Virtual functions enable derived classes to override base class functions, supporting runtime polymorphism."
  code={`class Base {
  public:
    virtual void display() { std::cout << "Base display" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
  public:
    void display() override { std::cout << "Derived display" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
  Base* obj = new Derived();
  obj->display();  // Calls Derived display
  delete obj;
}`}
  example={`// A base class Logger with virtual log()
// Derived classes implement their own log()`}
  whenToUse="Use when method behavior needs to vary in derived classes via base class pointers or references."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) What is an abstract class in C++?"
  answer="An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function and cannot be instantiated directly."
  code={`class Shape {
  public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual
};

class Circle : public Shape {
  public:
    void draw() override { std::cout << "Drawing Circle" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
  Shape* s = new Circle();
  s->draw();
  delete s;
}`}
  example={`// Abstract class Vehicle with draw(), start()
// Derived classes like Car implement those`}
  whenToUse="Use when you want to enforce derived classes to implement specific methods."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) What is multiple inheritance in C++?"
  answer="It allows a class to inherit from more than one base class, combining functionality from both."
  code={`class A {
  public:
    void showA() { std::cout << "Class A" << std::endl; }
};

class B {
  public:
    void showB() { std::cout << "Class B" << std::endl; }
};

class C : public A, public B {};

int main() {
  C obj;
  obj.showA();
  obj.showB();
  return 0;
}`}
  example={`// Class Printer
// Class Scanner
// Class Copier : public Printer, public Scanner`}
  whenToUse="Use when a class needs to incorporate functionality from multiple distinct classes."
/>
