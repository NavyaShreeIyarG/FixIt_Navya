<ComicQA
  question="1) What is the purpose of a debugger in C++ development?"
  answer="A debugger helps identify and fix runtime errors by allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze program flow."
  code={` Example using gdb:
 gdb ./program
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
(gdb) print variable`}
  example={`Use cases:
 1. Find segmentation faults
 2. Inspect variable values
 3. Trace execution path`}
  whenToUse="Use a debugger to investigate unexpected behavior, crashes, or logic errors during development."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What is a core dump and how is it useful?"
  answer="A core dump is a snapshot of a programâ€™s memory at the time of a crash, used to analyze the state of the program when it failed."
  code={` To generate a core dump:
 ulimit -c unlimited
 Run the program to crash
 Use gdb with core file:
 gdb ./program core`}
  example={` Core dump analysis:
 1. Inspect call stack at crash
 2. Examine variable values
 3. Identify cause of crash`}
  whenToUse="Enable core dumps to debug crashes that occur outside a debugger session or in production."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is profiling and why is it important?"
  answer="Profiling measures program performance by identifying bottlenecks, helping optimize CPU, memory, and I/O usage."
  code={` Using gprof:
 Compile with -pg
 g++ -pg program.cpp -o program
 ./program
 gprof program gmon.out > analysis.txt`}
  example={` Profiling targets:
 1. CPU hotspots
 2. Memory leaks
 3. Thread contention`}
  whenToUse="Use profiling to optimize performance-critical parts of your code after correctness is ensured."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) How does AddressSanitizer (ASan) help in debugging?"
  answer="ASan detects memory errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and memory leaks at runtime with minimal performance overhead."
  code={` Compile with ASan:
 g++ -fsanitize=address -g program.cpp -o program
 Run program normally to detect memory issues`}
  example={` Common detections:
 1. Heap buffer overflow
 2. Stack buffer overflow
 3. Use after free`}
  whenToUse="Enable ASan during development and testing to catch memory corruption bugs early."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) What is Valgrind and how is it used?"
  answer="Valgrind is a dynamic analysis tool to detect memory leaks, invalid memory access, and threading errors."
  code={` Run program under Valgrind:
 valgrind --leak-check=full ./program`}
  example={` Detects:
 1. Memory leaks
 2. Invalid reads/writes
 3. Use of uninitialized memory`}
  whenToUse="Use Valgrind to find subtle memory and threading bugs, especially in complex applications."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="6) What is the difference between `gdb` and `strace`?"
  answer="`gdb` is a source-level debugger for stepping through code and inspecting variables, while `strace` traces system calls made by a program."
  code={` Using strace:
 strace ./program`}
  example={` Use gdb for:
 1. Code logic debugging
 2. Variable inspection

 Use strace for:
 1. System call monitoring
 2. File/network debugging`}
  whenToUse="Use gdb for detailed debugging; use strace when diagnosing system call or environment issues."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) How do you use breakpoints effectively in debugging?"
  answer="Breakpoints pause program execution at specific lines or conditions, letting you inspect state and step through code interactively."
  code={` gdb example:
 (gdb) break MyClass.cpp:42
 (gdb) run
 (gdb) step`}
  example={` Breakpoint uses:
 1. Stop before a bug occurs
 2. Inspect variable values
 3. Step through loops or conditions`}
  whenToUse="Set breakpoints at suspected error points or critical logic sections to isolate issues."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What is the difference between static and dynamic analysis?"
  answer="Static analysis examines code without running it, while dynamic analysis checks behavior during program execution."
  code={` Examples:
 Static: clang-tidy, cppcheck
 Dynamic: Valgrind, ASan`}
  example={` Static analysis:
 1. Find coding errors early
 2. Enforce style and safety rules

 Dynamic analysis:
 1. Detect runtime errors
 2. Profile performance`}
  whenToUse="Use static analysis during development for early bug detection, and dynamic analysis to catch runtime issues."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is a memory leak and how can you detect it?"
  answer="A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not freed, causing increased memory usage over time. Tools like Valgrind or ASan help detect leaks."
  code={` Valgrind command:
 valgrind --leak-check=full ./program`}
  example={` Symptoms:
 1. Increasing memory consumption
 2. Program slowdown or crash

 Detection:
 Use memory analysis tools during testing.`}
  whenToUse="Run leak detection tools regularly to maintain stable memory usage and avoid crashes."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10) What is stack vs heap memory and their relevance in debugging?"
  answer="Stack memory stores local variables and function calls, automatically managed; heap memory is manually allocated/deallocated and prone to leaks."
  code={`void func() {
    int localVar = 5;            stack
    int* heapVar = new int(10);  heap
    delete heapVar;
}`}
  example={` Debugging:
 1. Stack overflows indicate deep recursion or large locals
 2. Heap errors include leaks and corruption`}
  whenToUse="Understand stack vs heap usage to debug memory errors and optimize performance."
/>
