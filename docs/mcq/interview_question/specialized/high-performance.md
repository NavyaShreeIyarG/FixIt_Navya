<ComicQA
  question="1) What is High-Performance C++?"
  answer="High-Performance C++ refers to writing programs that maximize execution speed and efficiency by optimizing algorithms, memory usage, and hardware utilization."
  code={`#pragma GCC optimize("O3")`}
  whenToUse="When building applications that require maximum speed."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) How can you improve cache locality in C++?"
  answer="Organize data in contiguous memory and access it sequentially to reduce cache misses."
  code={`std::vector<int> data(1000); for(auto& x : data) x++;`}
  whenToUse="When processing large data sets."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is loop unrolling?"
  answer="Loop unrolling reduces loop control overhead by executing multiple iterations in a single loop body."
  code={`for(int i=0; i<n; i+=4){ a[i]++; a[i+1]++; a[i+2]++; a[i+3]++; }`}
  whenToUse="When loops are performance bottlenecks."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) What are SIMD instructions in C++?"
  answer="SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) allows parallel processing of multiple data points using a single CPU instruction."
  code={`#include <immintrin.h> // SSE, AVX instructions`}
  whenToUse="When processing large numeric arrays."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) How does move semantics help performance?"
  answer="Move semantics transfer resources instead of copying them, reducing expensive memory operations."
  code={`std::vector<int> v2 = std::move(v1);`}
  whenToUse="When working with large objects or temporary values."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="6) What is false sharing in multithreading?"
  answer="False sharing occurs when threads modify different variables that reside on the same cache line, causing unnecessary cache invalidations."
  code={`alignas(64) int counter1; alignas(64) int counter2;`}
  whenToUse="When optimizing multi-threaded programs."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) How to reduce branch misprediction in C++?"
  answer="Use predictable branch patterns, remove unnecessary conditionals, and consider branchless programming."
  code={`int maxVal = a > b ? a : b;`}
  whenToUse="In performance-critical inner loops."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What is a memory pool?"
  answer="A memory pool preallocates a block of memory for objects, reducing heap allocation overhead."
  code={`MyPool pool; auto obj = pool.allocate();`}
  whenToUse="When creating/destroying many small objects frequently."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is lock-free programming?"
  answer="Lock-free programming uses atomic operations instead of mutexes to avoid contention and blocking."
  code={`std::atomic<int> counter; counter.fetch_add(1);`}
  whenToUse="When building high-performance concurrent systems."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10) How to profile a C++ program?"
  answer="Use tools like gprof, perf, or Visual Studio Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks."
  code={`g++ -pg main.cpp && ./a.out && gprof a.out gmon.out`}
  whenToUse="Before attempting any optimization."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="11) What is branchless programming?"
  answer="Branchless programming avoids conditional branches using arithmetic or bitwise operations."
  code={`x = (cond * val1) + (!cond * val2);`}
  whenToUse="When branch mispredictions are costly."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="12) How to use data-oriented design for performance?"
  answer="Store data in structures optimized for access patterns rather than object hierarchies."
  code={`struct Positions { float x[1000]; float y[1000]; };`}
  whenToUse="When working with large arrays of objects."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="13) How to avoid heap fragmentation?"
  answer="Use fixed-size allocators, memory pools, and avoid frequent small allocations."
  code={`std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource pool;`}
  whenToUse="When running long-lived, high-performance applications."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="14) What is CPU prefetching?"
  answer="Prefetching loads data into the CPU cache before it's needed to reduce memory latency."
  code={`__builtin_prefetch(&data[i+16]);`}
  whenToUse="When processing predictable data access patterns."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="15) How to parallelize algorithms in C++?"
  answer="Use std::execution policies with STL algorithms or libraries like OpenMP."
  code={`std::sort(std::execution::par, data.begin(), data.end());`}
  whenToUse="When algorithms can run independently on multiple cores."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="16) How does inline help performance?"
  answer="Inlining removes function call overhead, especially for small, frequently used functions."
  code={`inline int square(int x){ return x*x; }`}
  whenToUse="For very small functions in performance-critical code."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="17) What is the difference between O2 and O3 compiler optimizations?"
  answer="O2 focuses on balanced optimization without excessive compile time; O3 enables aggressive optimizations that may increase binary size."
  code={`g++ -O3 main.cpp`}
  whenToUse="When maximum speed is required and binary size is less important."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="18) How to reduce contention in multi-threaded C++?"
  answer="Use fine-grained locking, lock-free structures, and thread-local storage."
  code={`thread_local int localCounter;`}
  whenToUse="When multiple threads share resources."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="19) How to measure execution time accurately?"
  answer="Use std::chrono for high-resolution timing."
  code={`auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();`}
  whenToUse="When benchmarking specific code sections."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="20) Why profile before optimizing?"
  answer="Profiling ensures you focus on actual bottlenecks rather than guessing, saving time and effort."
  code={`// Profile first, then optimize`}
  whenToUse="Before making changes to improve performance."
/>
