<ComicQA
  question="1) What is advanced memory management in C++?"
  answer="It involves using techniques like custom allocators, memory pools, and RAII to optimize memory usage, prevent fragmentation, and improve performance."
  code={`std::vector<int, MyAllocator<int>> v;`}
  whenToUse="When memory performance and safety are critical."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) What is the difference between heap and stack allocation?"
  answer="Stack allocation is fast and automatic, while heap allocation is dynamic and allows flexible memory usage but is slower."
  code={`int x; // stack\nint* y = new int; // heap`}
  whenToUse="Stack for short-lived variables, heap for dynamic-sized data."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) What is placement new?"
  answer="Placement new constructs an object in a pre-allocated memory location without allocating additional memory."
  code={`new (buffer) MyClass();`}
  whenToUse="When using memory pools or custom allocators."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="4) How do custom allocators work in C++?"
  answer="They override the default allocation strategy for STL containers to improve performance or control memory usage."
  code={`std::vector<int, MyAllocator<int>> v;`}
  whenToUse="When fine-tuning allocation patterns for specific workloads."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) What is a memory pool?"
  answer="A pre-allocated block of memory used to serve multiple allocation requests, reducing heap allocation overhead."
  code={`MyPool pool; auto obj = pool.allocate();`}
  whenToUse="When frequently allocating/deallocating small objects."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="6) What are arena allocators?"
  answer="Allocators that reserve a large memory chunk and allocate from it sequentially, resetting all at once."
  code={`std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource pool;`}
  whenToUse="When lifetime of all objects is the same."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) How does RAII help in memory management?"
  answer="RAII ties resource lifetime to object lifetime, ensuring memory is released automatically."
  code={`std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(5));`}
  whenToUse="To prevent leaks in exception-safe code."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) What is the difference between unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr?"
  answer="unique_ptr owns a resource exclusively, shared_ptr allows shared ownership, and weak_ptr observes without ownership."
  code={`auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);`}
  whenToUse="unique_ptr for sole ownership, shared_ptr for shared ownership."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="9) What is memory fragmentation?"
  answer="Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory is split into small blocks, making large allocations fail."
  code={`// Use pools to avoid fragmentation`}
  whenToUse="When long-lived programs allocate and deallocate frequently."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="10) How to detect memory leaks in C++?"
  answer="Use tools like Valgrind, ASan, or Visual Leak Detector."
  code={`valgrind --leak-check=full ./app`}
  whenToUse="During testing and debugging."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="11) What is cache locality and why is it important?"
  answer="Cache locality ensures frequently accessed data is stored close together, improving performance."
  code={`std::vector<int> v(1000); for(auto& x:v) x++;`}
  whenToUse="When iterating over large datasets."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="12) How to ensure memory alignment in C++?"
  answer="Use alignas or std::aligned_alloc for proper hardware alignment."
  code={`alignas(64) int buffer[16];`}
  whenToUse="When working with SIMD or special hardware requirements."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="13) What is std::pmr?"
  answer="Polymorphic memory resources (PMR) allow customizing memory allocation at runtime for STL containers."
  code={`std::pmr::vector<int> v(&pool);`}
  whenToUse="When switching allocation strategies at runtime."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="14) How does object lifetime affect memory management?"
  answer="Understanding object lifetimes helps prevent leaks and dangling pointers."
  code={`{ std::unique_ptr<int> p = std::make_unique<int>(5); }`}
  whenToUse="When designing classes and resource ownership."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="15) How to avoid dangling pointers?"
  answer="Use smart pointers, reset them after use, and avoid returning raw pointers to temporary data."
  code={`ptr.reset();`}
  whenToUse="When raw pointers might outlive the object."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="16) How to reuse allocated memory?"
  answer="Use object pools or reuse containers with reserve/clear instead of reallocating."
  code={`v.clear(); v.reserve(1000);`}
  whenToUse="When repeatedly allocating similar-sized data."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="17) How to track memory usage in C++?"
  answer="Use custom new/delete overloads or profiling tools."
  code={`void* operator new(size_t sz) { log(sz); return malloc(sz); }`}
  whenToUse="When debugging memory-heavy applications."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="18) Why avoid new/delete in modern C++?"
  answer="They are error-prone and manual; prefer smart pointers or standard containers."
  code={`auto p = std::make_unique<int>(42);`}
  whenToUse="When writing exception-safe code."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="19) How to optimize for small object allocation?"
  answer="Use small object allocators that reduce per-object overhead."
  code={`boost::pool<> small_pool(sizeof(MyObject));`}
  whenToUse="When creating many small objects."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="20) How to handle out-of-memory situations safely?"
  answer="Check allocation results, use nothrow new, and design fallback strategies."
  code={`int* p = new(std::nothrow) int[1000];`}
  whenToUse="When running in memory-constrained environments."
/>
